This cheat sheet is for your future reference. It may seem long but donâ€™t worry, you donâ€™t need to know these ðŸ™‚ You can use this sheet for quick look ups, or simply referencing the syntax for your development. If you want to know more, you can always check the official documentation: Cheatsheet â€” Solidity 0.8.21 documentation (soliditylang.org)


1. Comments

Comments are used to annotate the code to make it easier to understand. They are ignored by the Solidity compiler.

- Single-line comments: Use // to comment out a single line.
- Multi-line comments: Use /* */ to comment out multiple lines.

```
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a multi-line comment
   that spans several lines */
```

2. Pragma Directive

The pragma directive helps to lock the Solidity compiler version for your smart contract. This ensures that your contract will only compile with a compatible compiler.
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

3. Import 

The import statement is used to import code from other Solidity files. This is useful for code reusability and separation of concerns.
```
import "./SomeContract.sol";
```

4. Data Types

Solidity supports various data types:

 uint: Unsigned integers, cannot be negative. 
 int: Signed integers, can be negative. 
 bool: Boolean, true or false. 
 address: Ethereum address. 
 bytes: Fixed-size byte arrays. 
 string: Dynamic-size string. 

```
uint256 x = 42;
bool isTrue = true;
address user = msg.sender;
```

5. Enums

Enums help in creating custom types with a range of predefined constants, making code more readable and less error-prone.

```
enum State { Created, Locked, Inactive }
State public state = State.Created;
```

6. Structs

Structs allow you to create complex data types that group variables under a single name.
```
struct Person {
    string name;
    uint age;
}
Person public person = Person("Alice", 30);
```

7. Arrays

Arrays are data structures that can hold more than one value at a time. They can be fixed-size or dynamic.
```
uint[] public numbers = [1, 2, 3];
```

8. Mappings

Mappings are key-value stores that allow you to link one data type to another.
```
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
```

9. Functions

Functions are the building blocks of a Solidity contract. They define executable code and can read and modify contract state.
```
function add(uint x, uint y) public pure returns (uint) {
    return x + y;
}
```

10. Function Modifiers

Modifiers are reusable pieces of code that can change the behavior of functions. They are often used for access control.
```
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _;
}
```

11. Events

Events provide a logging mechanism for the blockchain. They are crucial for frontend applications to "listen" to changes in smart contracts.
```
event LogData(uint indexed data);

emit LogData(42);
```

12. Error Handling

Solidity uses require, assert, and revert for error handling:


 require: Used for validating inputs and conditions. Consumes less gas. 
 assert: Used for internal errors. 
 revert: Similar to require but allows you to revert complex operations. 
```
require(x > 0, "x must be greater than 0");
```

13. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a contract to acquire properties and behavior (i.e., state variables and functions) of a parent contract.
```
contract Child is Parent {
    // code
}
```

14. Interfaces 

Interfaces define a contract's external functions and enable the interaction between different contracts.
```
interface IERC20 {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
}
```

15. Libraries

Libraries are reusable pieces of code that can be called from within your contracts. They are deployed only once at a specific address and linked to your contract.
```
using SafeMath for uint;

uint x = y.add(z);
```
 Storage: Persistent data storage that forms the contract state. Changes are very costly in terms of gas. 
 Memory: Temporary data storage. It's erased between external function calls and is cheaper to use than storage.
```
uint[] storage myArray;
uint[] memory tempArray;
```

17. Payable

The payable keyword allows a function to receive Ether.
```
function deposit() public payable {
    // code
}
```

18. Fallback and Receive Functions

These functions are executed when a contract receives Ether without a function being called.

 Fallback: A default function marked with fallback. 
 Receive: Explicit function to receive Ether, must be marked external payable.
```
fallback() external payable {
    // code
}

receive() external payable {
    // code
}
```

19. Constructor

A constructor is a special function that gets executed only once when the contract is deployed.
```
constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

20. Visibility
    
 public: Accessible from this and other contracts. 
 private: Accessible only from this contract. 
 internal: Like private but also accessible in derived contracts. 
 external: Only accessible from other contracts.
 ```
uint public x;
uint private y;
```
21. View and Pure Functions

 view: Functions that read the state but don't modify it. 
 pure: Functions that neither read nor modify the state.
```
function getView() public view returns (uint) {
    return x;
}

function getPure() public pure returns (uint) {
    return 42;
}
```
